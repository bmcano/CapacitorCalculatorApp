    <string name="capacitor_calculator_information_body_1">Capacitors come in many shapes and sizes, each with slight variations for the markings they hold. For the most part if the capacitance is not directly marked, a three digit code determines the capacitance, like 103 for example.</string>
    <string name="capacitor_calculator_information_body_2">This code is just three numbers, but there can be other numbers and letters that may surround this part. Usually, these values represent tolerance and voltage rating.</string>
    <string name="capacitor_calculator_information_body_3">Tolerance is just one capital letter that usually directly follows the three digit code, for example 103J could appear where J is the tolerance indicator.</string>
    <string name="capacitor_calculator_information_body_4">Voltage rating is also another common value that can appear on capacitors, it is typically a two digit code that is a number followed by a letter, like 2A as an example.</string>
    <string name="capacitor_calculator_information_body_5">It is important to note that capacitors come in a variety of types, each tailored to specific applications based on their characteristics, like reliability, voltage ratings, capacitance values, etc.</string>

    <string name="ceramic_details_title">Ceramic Capacitor</string>
    <string name="ceramic_details_general_information_1">A ceramic capacitor is a fixed-value capacitor where the ceramic material acts as the dielectric. It is constructed of two or more alternating layers of ceramic as well as a metal layer acting as the electrodes. The composition of the ceramic material determines the electrical behavior and applications.</string>
    <string name="ceramic_details_general_information_2">Ceramic capacitors are the most produced and used capacitors in electronic equipment that incorporate approximately one trillion pieces per year.</string>
    <string name="ceramic_details_capacitance">Ceramic capacitors typically use a shorthand three-digit code (103) to indicate their capacitance. This code may also include other markings to include tolerance (J) and voltage rating (2A).</string>
    <string name="ceramic_details_applications_1">There are currently two standard classes of ceramic capacitors both of which specialized in different things.</string>
    <string name="ceramic_details_applications_2">Class 1 ceramic capacitors will offer high stability and low losses for resonant circuit applications.</string>
    <string name="ceramic_details_applications_3">Class 2 ceramic capacitors will offer high volumetric efficiency for by-pass, decoupling, and smoothing applications.</string>

    <string name="film_details_title">Film Capacitor</string>
    <string name="film_details_general_information">Film capacitors are electrical capacitors with an insulating plastic film as the dielectric, sometimes combined with paper as carrier of the electrodes.</string>
    <string name="film_details_capacitance">For many styles of the film capacitor the capacitance and other important values are directly printed on the capacitor. If it is not, then it will use the shorthand three-digit code to indicate their capacitance and other related values.</string>
    <string name="film_details_characteristics_1">These capacitors are the most-used dielectric film in industrial capacitors and also in power capacitor types. The polypropylene film material absorbs less moisture than polyester film and is therefore also suitable for \"naked\" designs without any coating.</string>
    <string name="film_details_characteristics_2">The polyester film adsorbs very little moisture, and this feature makes it suitable for \"naked\" designs without any further coating needed. They are the low-cost mass-produced capacitors in modern electronics, featuring relatively small dimensions with relatively high capacitance values. The low cost of polyester and the relatively compact dimensions are the main reasons for the high prevalence of PET film capacitors in modern designs.</string>
    <string name="film_details_characteristics_3">These capacitors are physically larger for a given capacitance and rated voltage value. In spite of this, PEN film capacitors are preferred over PET when the ambient temperature during operation of the capacitors is permanently above 125°C. The special PEN \"high voltage\" dielectric offers excellent electrical properties at high voltages and high temperatures (175°C).</string>
    <string name="film_details_characteristics_4">The temperature dependence of the capacitance of PPS film capacitors over the entire temperature range is very small (±1.5%) compared with other film capacitors. Also the frequency dependence in the range from 100 Hz to 100 kHz of the capacitance of the PPS film capacitors is ±0.5%, which is very low compared with other film capacitors.</string>
    <string name="film_details_characteristics_5">These capacitors feature a very high temperature resistance up to 200°C, and even further up to 260°C, with a voltage derating. The dissipation factor 0.0002 is quite small.</string>
    <string name="film_details_characteristics_6">These capacitors were well known as inexpensive film capacitors for general purpose applications, where high capacitance stability, low dissipation factor, and low leakage currents were needed.</string>
    <string name="film_details_characteristics_7">These capacitors have a low dissipation factor and because of their relatively temperature independent electrical properties of about ±80 ppm over the entire temperature range. However, the main supplier of polycarbonate film for capacitors had ceased the production of this polymer in film form as of the year 2000.</string>
    <string name="film_details_applications_1">Therefore, polypropylene film capacitors are suitable for applications in frequency-determining circuits, filters, oscillator circuits, audio circuits, timers, and for high-frequency applications. They are also useful for compensation of inductive coils in precision filter applications.</string>
    <string name="film_details_applications_2">Polyester film capacitors are mainly used for general purpose applications or semi-critical circuits with operating temperatures up to 125°C.</string>
    <string name="film_details_applications_3">PEN capacitors are mainly used for non-critical filtering, coupling and decoupling in electronic circuits, when the temperature dependencies do not matter.</string>
    <string name="film_details_applications_4">PPS capacitors are well-suited for applications in frequency-determining circuits and for high-temperature applications. They are also an ideal replacement for polycarbonate film capacitors.</string>
    <string name="film_details_applications_5">They are typically used in military equipment, aerospace, geological probes, burn-in circuits, and high-quality audio circuits.</string>
    <string name="film_details_applications_6">However, PS capacitors have an important advantage - they have a temperature coefficient near zero and are useful in tuned circuits where temperature drift must be avoided.</string>
    <string name="film_details_applications_7">They have had many applications for low-loss and temperature-stable applications in timing circuits, precision analog circuits, and signal filters in applications with tough environmental conditions.</string>

    <string name="electrolytic_title">Electrolytic Capacitor</string>
    <string name="electrolytic_details_general_information">Electrolytic capacitors are polarized components because of their asymmetrical construction and must be operated with a higher potential (i.e., more positive) on the positive lead (anode) than on the negative lead (cathode) at all times. This is why the polarity is marked on the device. Applying a reverse polarity voltage, or a voltage exceeding the maximum rated working voltage of as little as 1 or 1.5 volts, can damage the dielectric causing catastrophic failure of the capacitor itself.</string>
    <string name="electrolytic_details_capacitance_1">Electrolytic capacitors often have their capacitance value printed directly on the casing. It is usually expressed in micro-farads (µF), which can be seen in the image above.</string>
    <string name="electrolytic_details_capacitance_2">Along with the capacitance value, you will also see a voltage rating. This indicates the maximum voltage the capacitor can handle.</string>
    <string name="electrolytic_details_characteristics_1">The non-solid or so-called \"wet\" aluminium electrolytic capacitors were and are the cheapest among all other conventional capacitors. They provide the cheapest solutions for high capacitance or voltage values for decoupling and buffering purposes. They are also insensitive to low ohmic charging, discharging, and to low-energy transients.</string>
    <string name="electrolytic_details_characteristics_2">Tantalum electrolytic capacitors are mainly used in electronic devices in which little space is available or a low profile is required. They operate reliably over a wide temperature range without large parameter deviations.</string>
    <string name="electrolytic_details_characteristics_3">Niobium electrolytic capacitors are in direct competition with industrial tantalum electrolytic capacitors because niobium is more readily available. Their properties are comparable.</string>
    <string name="electrolytic_details_applications">Non-solid electrolytic capacitors can be found in nearly all areas of electronic devices, with the exception of military applications. However, in military and space applications only tantalum electrolytic capacitors have the necessary approvals.</string>

    <string name="super_title">Supercapacitor</string>
    <string name="super_details_general_information">A supercapacitor (SC) is a high-capacity capacitor, with a capacitance value much higher than solid-state capacitors but with lower voltage limits. It bridges the gap between electrolytic capacitors and rechargeable batteries. It typically stores 10 to 100 times more energy per unit volume or mass than electrolytic capacitors, can accept and deliver charge much faster than batteries, and tolerates many more charge and discharge cycles than rechargeable batteries.</string>
    <string name="super_details_capacitance">Supercapacitors typically have both their capacitance and voltage rating directly marked. Typical values are in the range of farads (F), three to six orders of magnitude larger than those of electrolytic capacitors.</string>
    <string name="super_details_applications">Supercapacitors are used in applications requiring many rapid charge/discharge cycles. In automobiles, buses, trains, cranes, and elevators, they are used for regenerative braking, short-term energy storage, or burst-mode power delivery. Smaller units are used as power backup for static random-access memory (SRAM).</string>
